    "is positioned above a clear glass containing a reddish-brown liquid and a spoon. The robotic arm is "
    "in the process of pouring a transparent liquid into the glass. To the left of the pitcher, there is "
    "an opened jar with a similar reddish-brown substance visible through its transparent body. In the background, "
    "a vase with white flowers and a brown couch are partially visible, adding to the contemporary ambiance. The "
    "lighting is bright, casting soft shadows on the table. The robotic arm's movements are smooth and controlled, "
    "demonstrating precision in its task. As the video progresses, the robotic arm completes the pour, leaving the "
    "glass half-filled with the reddish-brown liquid. The jar remains untouched throughout the sequence, and the "
    "spoon inside the glass remains stationary. The other robotic arm on the right side also stays stationary "
    "throughout the video. The final frame captures the robotic arm with the pitcher finishing the pour, with the "
    "glass now filled to a higher level, while the pitcher is slightly tilted but still held securely by the gripper."
